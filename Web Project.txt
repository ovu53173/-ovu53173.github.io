Cooking as a family or with friends and loved ones brings us together because we are able
to share our culture and heritage through food and give each other nourishment. Coming together
and sharing a meal is the most commual and binding thins in almost every part of the world.
Being able to make a dish and share that with people you love is one of the most uniserval concepts
because it is the root of our survival. Recipes are passed on from generation to generation and 
this makes food a very special thing. Some of my very first memeories are in the kitchen with
my mom.

Moving from one country to another, I now realize how special those memories are and how imporatant
food is for togetherness and culture. Food is a great vechicle for sharing culture with people
from different backgrounds. I was born and rasied in Nigeria and I remember how hard it was 
for me to ingerate into the "American Culture". Through food I was able to communicate with 
my new friends. They informed me of thier favorite fast food resturants and I showed them
my favorite Nigerian dishes and this created some lifelong friendships.

Overall, sharing food with others brings a wealth of benefits. These moments help us make 
friends, find love and end hostitity. Breaking bread together is a way to remove barriers and
helps us explore new culture and bulid stronger relationships when we socialise. Food helps 
us stay connected. For example talking about the day is perfect way to stay connected with
members of your family.
